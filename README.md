[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/idaks/Games-and-Argumentation)

This repository serve as the centralized place to hold latest code for Games and Argumentation


## Codespace Setup

To set up your environment, simply click on the `Open in GitHub Codespaces` button above. Once the environment setup is complete, you'll be presented with an online version of VScode.

> **Notice:** If you encounter alerts like "Container build failed. Check troubleshooting guide" or "This codespace is currently running in recovery mode due to a configuration error", don't panic. Just press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `>Codespaces: Full Rebuild Container` to resolve the issue.

This process will take around 4-8 minutes. **Please do not** press any button until you see something like: `@username  ➜ /workspaces/Games-and-Argumentation (main) $ `

#### For Non-First-Time Usage
You can find the codespace you created at [this link](https://github.com/codespaces).

## Launch Jupyter

After setting up the codespace environment:

1. Type `jupyter Lab` in the Terminal of the VScode online version.
   
   > **Notice:** Sometimes, due to codespace limitations, the terminal may go blank. Simply refreshing your browser should solve the problem.

2. This will lead you to the Jupyter Lab interface, where you can run:
   - `Tutorial.ipynb`
